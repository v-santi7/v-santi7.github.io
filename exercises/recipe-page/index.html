        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                To a saucepan over medium heat, add the condensed milk, butter, 
                cocoa powder, and heavy cream. Cook, stirring constantly, until 
                the butter is melted and the mixture is smooth and glossy.
            </li>
            &emsp;
            <li>
                Lower the heat and stir in the chopped chocolate, 
                vanilla extract, and salt until fully melted and combined. 
                Remove from the heat.
            
            </li>
            &emsp;
            <li>
                In a large bowl, add in the chopped tea biscuits and walnuts, 
                pour the chocolate mix over, and use a rubber spatula to fold 
                gently until everything is evenly coated.
            </li>
            &emsp;
            <li>
                Divide the mixture evenly between two pieces of plastic wrap. 
                Shape each portion into a log, then roll tightly to seal.
            </li>
            &emsp;
            <li>
                Refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours. Unwrap, dust the logs 
                generously with powdered sugar, then slice and serve.
