        <h1>Crispy Bagel Bites</h1>
        <p>
            These tortilla pinwheels are quick and easy to make with just a few 
            basic ingredients. Simply roll, cut, and crisp them up in a skillet 
            with butter until golden brown. Serve as a yummy snack or quick 
            breakfast! My kids especially love this simple recipe.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large flour tortilla</li>
            <li>2-3 tbsp cream cheese</li>
            <li>Everything Bagel seasoning (to taste)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Use a butter knife to evenly spread the cream cheese all over 
                your tortilla and then sprinkle with seasoning
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Tightly roll the tortilla up into a log shape and then cut into 
                bite-size pieces. I usually get about 9 pinwheels out of one 
                large tortilla.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Melt 1 tbsp of butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. 
                Add your pinwheels and stir them into the butter, evenly 
                coating all sides. Cook, flipping them often, until golden 
                brown and crispy.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Allow them to rest for about 5 minutes before enjoying. 
                They are much better once the cream cheese has hardened a bit!
