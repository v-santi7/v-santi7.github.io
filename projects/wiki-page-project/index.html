            <b>Crown shyness</b> (also <i>canopy disengagement,<sup>[1]</sup> 
                canopy shyness,<sup>[2]</sup></i> or 
                <i> inter-crown spacing</i><sup>[3]</sup> ) is a phenomenon 
                observed in some 
                tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not 
                touch each other, forming a 
                canopy with channel-like gaps.<sup>[4]</sup><sup>[5]</sup>The 
                phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the same species, 
                but also occurs 
                between trees of different species.</
